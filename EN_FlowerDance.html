							<p>This is a performance video I shot during the summer of 2022 for the children at Zhoushan Yuhua Primary School. I mostly completed the filming, editing, and instrument mixing on my own, making it perhaps the largest project I've undertaken in the realm of performance videos.</p>
							<p>
								This experience was possibly my first time taking on the role of a director. Although it wasn't a full-fledged film crew, the elements of actors, props, and locations were very much present, requiring me to think about the most efficient solutions in terms of coordination. Despite not having formal training in scriptwriting or directing, I managed to handle this small-scale project effectively by analyzing potential scenarios and drafting a rough script.

								â†‘ The recording part of the work was more closely related to my studies at Beijing Contemporary Music Academy, and collaborating with the children made what could have been a tedious task more enjoyable. During this process, my role was primarily to guide the children's performance.							</p>


							<p>
								In the final stage of audio post-production, the mixing process, from a technical standpoint, was not overly complex. When I integrated it into the same workflow as the video editing, I found that the production process somewhat resembled the mindset required for film scoring. Perhaps music videos (MVs) can be considered a form of mini-cinema, representing a diverse art form. From a coordination perspective, maintaining consistency between the visual department's tasks (filming, editing, color grading) and the sound department's tasks (recording, composing, mixing) is essential for achieving the best outcome.
